# Arkanoid Awareness
 The world renowned arcade game developed using java applets with a twist
Arkanoid is a famous arcade game also known as Breakout created by Atari. We decided to recreate this game using applets.
Inorder to create awareness, we added a little twist to it by changing the paddle making it resemble a cigarette and the blocks in the shape of lungs. As we tend to play the game, we destroy the blocks (Metaphorically destroying lungs using cigarettes).
Each of the file contains a specific part of the code and the file 'Arkanoid' is the controller class.
